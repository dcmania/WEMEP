Wind Energy Model Evaluation Protocol (WEMEP)
====================================================

WEMEP is a community project for the documentation of a Wind Energy Model Evaluation Protocol, developed within the `IEA-Wind <https://community.ieawind.org/home>`_, with the following objectives: 

* To develop an international framework to guide model developers and users on methodologies and best practices to conduct formal verification and validation (V&V).
* To promote collaboration between modeling communities and foster interdisciplinary research and development towards integrated models.  
* To link to published open-access repositories of models, validation cases and data analysis scripts.

Modeling communities are welcomed to implement the MEP and contribute with open access repositories that can be interopeable with those from other communities.
