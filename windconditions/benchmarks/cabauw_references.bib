	abstract = {A summary of the initial results of the “NEWA Meso-Micro Challenge for Wind Resource Assessment” is presented. The objective of this activity, conducted in the context of the New European Wind Atlas (NEWA) project, is to establish a process for the evaluation of meso-micro methodologies in the context of wind resource and wind turbine site suitability assessment. A hierarchy of methodologies that rely on coupling mesoscale and microscale models is evaluated as a tradeoff between accuracy and computational cost in terms of relevant wind conditions for wind turbine siting such as annual energy production, turbulence intensity, etc. Besides integrated annual quantities, these metrics are analyzed in terms of atmospheric boundary-layer drivers at wind climate (mesoscale tendencies) and site characteristics (atmospheric stability). This is used to characterize errors leading to the identification of knowledge-gaps in the model-chain. This first phase of the meso-micro challenge analyzes Cabauw onshore met mast in horizontally-homogeneous conditions to focus the assessment on mesoscale-to-microscale downscaling methods rather than on site complexity. A second phase of the challenge will add sites in heterogeneous terrain conditions from the NEWA database of experiments.},

The case consists of a diurnal cycle, measured at the 200-m tall Cabauw tower in the Netherlands, including a nocturnal low-level jet. The benchmark includes a sensitivity analysis of WRF simulations using two input meteorological databases and five planetary boundary-layer schemes. A reference set of mesoscale tendencies is used to drive microscale simulations using RANS k-ϵ and LES turbulence models. The validation is based on rotor-based quantities of interest. Cycle-integrated mean absolute errors are used to quantify model performance. The results of the benchmark are used to discuss input uncertainties from mesoscale modelling, different meso-micro coupling strategies (online vs offline) and consistency between RANS and LES codes when dealing with boundary-layer mean flow quantities. Overall, all the microscale simulations produce a consistent coupling with mesoscale forcings.},

	url = {https://zenodo.org/record/4195067},
	abstract = {The vertical structure of the stable atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) in open-sea offshore conditions is characterized based on flux-profile measurements at the Fino1 met mast, 45 km off the coast of Germany, during the first six months of 2006. The large data availability of flux measurements at three height levels (40, 60 and 80 m) allow a careful selection of profiles for which the most important ABL parameters of CFDWind model are obtained in non-dimensional form: velocity gradient, mixing-length, turbulent kinetic energy and eddy viscosity. Similar to onshore conditions, the non-dimensional ABL parameters show local scaling behaviour based on local Obukhov length and friction velocity scales. Functional relationships are extracted and compared to classical functions used over land. The non-dimensional wind shear is larger than the classical Dyer's function at moderate stabilities probably due to the presence of low-level jets. A weak dependency of the non-dimensional turbulent kinetic energy on stability is noticed at moderate to high stabilities. Using a calibrated stability function, it is possible to match the mean wind shear and mixing length profiles with CFDWind mixing-length model in the same way as it is done in onshore conditions. Nevertheless, the large spread of the flux-profile data reveals that ABL scaling might be not only dependent on local z/L but also on other parameters like the wave age. Ensemble-averaged profiles are reasonably well reproduced with quasy-steady simulations allowing to extend traditional CFD-based wind resource assessment methodologies to account for stability without the need to run costly unstable simulations.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} The GEWEX Atmospheric Boundary Layer Studies (GABLS) 1, 2 and 3 are used to develop a methodology for the design and testing of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) models for wind energy applications. The first two GABLS cases are based on idealized boundary conditions and are suitable for verification purposes by comparing with results from higher-fidelity models based on large-eddy simulation. Results from three single-column RANS models, of 1st, 1.5th and 2nd turbulence closure order, show high consistency in predicting the mean flow. The third GABLS case is suitable for the study of these ABL models under realistic forcing such that validation versus observations from the Cabauw meteorological tower are possible. The case consists on a diurnal cycle that leads to a nocturnal low-level jet and addresses fundamental questions related to the definition of the large-scale forcing, the interaction of the ABL with the surface and the evaluation of model results with observations. The simulations are evaluated in terms of surface-layer fluxes and wind energy quantities of interest: rotor equivalent wind speed, hub-height wind direction, wind speed shear and wind direction veer. The characterization of mesoscale forcing is based on spatially and temporally averaged momentum budget terms from Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations. These mesoscale tendencies are used to drive single-column models, which were verified previously in the first two GABLS cases, to first demonstrate that they can produce similar wind profile characteristics to the WRF simulations even though the physics are more simplified. The added value of incorporating different forcing mechanisms into microscale models is quantified by systematically removing forcing terms in the momentum and heat equations. This mesoscale-to-microscale modeling approach is affected, to a large extent, by the input uncertainties of the mesoscale tendencies. Deviations from the profile observations are reduced by introducing observational nudging based on measurements that are typically available from wind energy campaigns. This allows the discussion of the added value of using remote sensing instruments versus tower measurements in the assessment of wind profiles for tall wind turbines reaching heights of 200 m.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A self-consistent two-equation closure treating buoyancy and plant drag effects has been developed, through consideration of the behaviour of the supplementary equation for the length-scale-determining variable in homogeneous turbulent flow. Being consistent with the canonical flow regimes of grid turbulence and wall-bounded flow, the closure is also valid for homogeneous shear flows commonly observed inside tall vegetative canopies and in non-neutral atmospheric conditions. Here we examine the most often used two-equation models, namely \$\$\{E - {\textbackslash}varepsilon\}\$\$and E − ω (where \$\$\{{\textbackslash}varepsilon\}\$\$is the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy, E, and \$\$\{{\textbackslash}omega = {\textbackslash}varepsilon/E\}\$\$is the specific dissipation), comparing the suggested buoyancy-modified closure against Monin–Obukhov similarity theory. Assessment of the closure implementing both buoyancy and plant drag together has been done, comparing the results of the two models against each other. It has been found that the E − ω model gives a better reproduction of complex atmospheric boundary-layer flows, including less sensitivity to numerical artefacts, than does the \$\$\{E -{\textbackslash}varepsilon\}\$\$model. Re-derivation of the \$\$\{{\textbackslash}varepsilon\}\$\$equation from the ω equation, however, leads to the \$\$\{E - {\textbackslash}varepsilon\}\$\$model implementation that produces results identical to the E − ω model. Overall, numerical results show that the closure performs well, opening new possibilities for application of such models to tasks related to the atmospheric boundary layer—where it is important to adequately account for the influences of both vegetation and atmospheric stability.},
