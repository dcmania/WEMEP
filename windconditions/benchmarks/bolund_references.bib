This paper provides an overview of the building-block validation approach applied to flow-over-terrain models, including best practices for the benchmarking and data processing procedures for the analysis and qualification of validation datasets from wind resource assessment campaigns. A hierarchy of test cases has been proposed for flow-over-terrain model evaluation, from Monin-Obukhov similarity theory for verification of surface-layer properties, to the Leipzig profile for the near-neutral atmospheric boundary layer, to flow over isolated hills (Askervein and Bolund) to flow over mountaneous complex terrain (Alaiz). A summary of results from the first benchmarks are used to illustrate the model evaluation protocol applied to flow-over-terrain modeling in neutral conditions.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of data from a measurement campaign performed at the Bolund peninsula in Denmark in the winter of 2007–2008. Bolund is a small isolated hill exhibiting a significantly steep escarpment in the main wind direction. The physical shape of Bolund represents, in a scaled-down form, a typical wind turbine site in complex terrain. Because of its small size the effect of atmospheric stratification can be neglected, which makes the Bolund experiment ideal for the validation of neutral flow models and hence model scenarios most relevant to wind energy. We have carefully investigated the upstream conditions. With a 7-km fetch over water, the incoming flow is characterized as flow over flat terrain with a local roughness height based on the surface momentum flux. The nearly perfect upstream conditions are important in forming a meaningful quantitative description of the flow over the Bolund hill. Depending on the wind direction, we find a maximum speed-up of 30\% at the hill top accompanied by a maximum 300\% enhancement of turbulence intensity. A closer inspection reveals transient behaviour with recirculation zones. From the wind energy context, this implies that the best site for erecting a turbine based on resource constraints unfortunately also imposes a penalty of high dynamic loads. On the lee side of Bolund, recirculation occurs with the turbulence intensity remaining significantly enhanced even at one hill length downstream. Its transient behaviour and many recirculation zones place Bolund in a category in which the linear flow theory is not applicable.},

	abstract = {Bolund measurements were used for a blind comparison of microscale flow models. Fifty-seven models ranging from numerical to physical were used, including large-eddy simulation (LES) models, Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) models, and linearized models, in addition to wind-tunnel and water-channel experiments. Many assumptions of linearized models were violated when simulating the flow around Bolund. As expected, these models showed large errors. Expectations were higher for LES models. However, of the submitted LES results, all had difficulties in applying the specified boundary conditions and all had large speed-up errors. In contrast, the physical models both managed to apply undisturbed ‘free wind’ boundary conditions and achieve good speed-up results. The most successful models were RANS with two-equation closures. These models gave the lowest errors with respect to speed-up and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) prediction.},

By generating alternative meshes, grid independent results are achieved that are compared to measured wind speed and turbulence characteristics in the four flow cases.

	abstract = {In the wind-energy sector, wind-power forecasting, turbine siting, and turbine-design selection are all highly dependent on a precise evaluation of atmospheric wind conditions. On-site measurements provide reliable data; however, in complex terrain and at the scale of a wind farm, local measurements may be insufficient for a detailed site description. On highly variable terrain, numerical models are commonly used but still constitute a challenge regarding simulation and interpretation. We propose a joint state-of-the-art study of two approaches to modelling atmospheric flow over the Bolund hill: a wind-tunnel test and a large-eddy simulation (LES). The approach has the particularity of describing both methods in parallel in order to highlight their similarities and differences. The work provides a first detailed comparison between field measurements, wind-tunnel experiments and numerical simulations. The systematic and quantitative approach used for the comparison contributes to a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each model and, therefore, to their enhancement. Despite fundamental modelling differences, both techniques result in only a 5 \% difference in the mean wind speed and 15 \% in the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). The joint comparison makes it possible to identify the most difficult features to model: the near-ground flow and the wake of the hill. When compared to field data, both models reach 11 \% error for the mean wind speed, which is close to the best performance reported in the literature. For the TKE, a great improvement is found using the LES model compared to previous studies (20 \% error). Wind-tunnel results are in the low range of error when compared to experiments reported previously (40 \% error). This comparison highlights the potential of such approaches and gives directions for the improvement of complex flow modelling.},

	abstract = {Simulation of local atmospheric flows around complex topography is important for several applications in wind energy (short-term wind forecasting and turbine siting and control), local weather prediction in mountainous regions and avalanche risk assessment. However, atmospheric simulation around steep mountain topography remains challenging, and a number of different approaches are used to represent such topography in numerical models. The immersed boundary method (IBM) is particularly well-suited for efficient and numerically stable simulation of flow around steep terrain. It uses a homogenous grid and permits a fast meshing of the topography. Here, we use the IBM in conjunction with a large-eddy simulation (LES) and test it against two unique datasets. In the first comparison, the LES is used to reproduce experimental results from a wind-tunnel study of a smooth three-dimensional hill. In the second comparison, we simulate the wind field around the Bolund Hill, Denmark, and make direct comparisons with field measurements. Both cases show good agreement between the simulation results and the experimental data, with the largest disagreement observed near the surface. The source of error is investigated by performing additional simulations with a variety of spatial resolutions and surface roughness properties.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACTThe Bolund experiment has been reproduced in a neutral boundary layer wind tunnel (WT) at scale 1:115 for two Reynolds numbers. All the results have been obtained for an incoming flow from the 270 o wind direction (transect B in the Bolund experiment jargon). Vertical scans of the velocity field are obtained using non-time resolved two components particle image velocimetry. Time-resolved velocity time series with a three component hot-wire probe have been also measured for transects at 2 and 5 m height and in the vertical transects at met masts M6, M3 and M8 locations. Special attention has been devoted to the detailed characterization of the inflow in order to reduce uncertainties in future comparisons with other physical and numerical simulations. Emphasis is placed on the analysis of spectral functions of the undisturbed flow and those of the flow above the island. The result's reproducibility and trustworthiness have been addressed through redundancy measurements using particle image velocimetry, two and three components hot-wire anemometry. The bias in the prediction of the mean speed is similar to the one reported during the Bolund experiment by the physical modellers. However, certain reduction of the bias in the estimation of the turbulent kinetic energy is achieved. The WT results of spectra and cosprectra have revealed a behaviour similar to the full-scale measurements in some relevant locations, showing that WT modelling can contribute to provide valid information about these important structural loading factors.
