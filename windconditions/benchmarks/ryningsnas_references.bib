	abstract = {An analysis and interpretation of measurements from a 138-m tall tower located in a forested landscape is presented. Measurement errors and statistical uncertainties are carefully evaluated to ensure high data quality. A 40\$\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ \$\$∘wide wind-direction sector is selected as the most representative for large-scale forest conditions, and from that sector first-, second- and third-order statistics, as well as analyses regarding the characteristic length scale, the flux-profile relationship and surface roughness are presented for a wide range of stability conditions. The results are discussed with focus on the validity of different scaling regimes. Significant wind veer, decay of momentum fluxes and reduction in shear length scales with height are observed for all stability classes, indicating the influence of the limited depth of the boundary layer on the measured profiles. Roughness sublayer characteristics are however not detected in the presented analysis. Dimensionless gradients are shown to follow theoretical curves up to 100 m in stable conditions despite surface-layer approximations being invalid. This is attributed to a balance of momentum decay and reduced shear length scale growth with height. The wind profile shows a strong stability dependence of the aerodynamic roughness length, with a 50 \% decrease from neutral to stable conditions.},

	abstract = {This study presents an evaluation of wind field simulations, in neutral atmospheric conditions, above a heterogeneous forest. The calculations were performed with Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) code OpenFOAM, with explicit modelling of the forest through drag coefficient and forest density. The findings indicate that a large modelling domain is needed in order to reproduce the measurements in different wind directions, since the effect of far upwind forest characteristics influence the wind and turbulence profiles. It is further shown that even though the low resolution of the LES simulations lead to slightly misrepresented single point turbulence characteristics, two point turbulence characteristics are well predicted due to spatial filtering of the small scales.},
