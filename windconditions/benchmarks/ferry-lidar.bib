	abstract = {The New European Wind Atlas project will create a freely accessible wind atlas covering Europe and Turkey, develop the model chain to create the atlas and perform a series of experiments on flow in many different kinds of complex terrain to validate the models. This paper describes the experiments of which some are nearly completed while others are in the planning stage. All experiments focus on the flow properties that are relevant for wind turbines, so the main focus is the mean flow and the turbulence at heights between 40 and 300 m. Also extreme winds, wind shear and veer, and diurnal and seasonal variations of the wind are of interest. Common to all the experiments is the use of Doppler lidar systems to supplement and in some cases replace completely meteorological towers. Many of the lidars will be equipped with scan heads that will allow for arbitrary scan patterns by several synchronized systems. Two pilot experiments, one in Portugal and one in Germany, show the value of using multiple synchronized, scanning lidar, both in terms of the accuracy of the measurements and the atmospheric physical processes that can be studied. The experimental data will be used for validation of atmospheric flow models and will by the end of the project be freely available.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Wind energy in complex terrains’.},

	abstract = {Measuring wind offshore in deep water depths will be a future challenge. Where the sea bed foundation installation for fixed meteorological masts is impossible, floating systems tend to be a sophisticated solution. In addition to the use of moored lidar- buoy systems, ship-lidar systems are an alternative solution for a number of different applications. In this paper we describe general aspects of motion influences on lidar measurements as well as two motion-correction methods for motion-influenced lidar measurements. The implementation of the ship-lidar system and different scanning modes will be presented. First measurements were carried out as part of the EERA-DTOC project. Hence a verification of one of the two correction algorithms as well as first results from wake measurements behind the Alpha Ventus offshore wind farm will be shown. This comprises distinct wind speed wake losses and an increasing turbulence intensity in a distance of approximately 2km behind the wind farm.},

	abstract = {This article presents the Ferry Lidar Experiment, which is one of the NEWA Experiments, a set of unique flow experiments conducted as part of the New European Wind Atlas (NEWA) project. These experiments have been prepared and conducted to create adequate datasets for mesoscale and microscale model validation. For the Ferry Lidar Experiment a Doppler lidar instrument was placed on a ferry connecting Kiel and Klaipeda in the Southern Baltic Sea from February to June 2017. A comprehensive set of all relevant motions was recorded together with the lidar data and processed in order to obtain and provide corrected wind time series. Due to the existence of the motion effects, the obtained data are essentially different from typical on-site data used for wind resource assessments in the wind industry. First comparisons show that they can be well related to mapped wind trajectories from the output of a numerical weather prediction model showing a reasonable correlation. More detailed validation studies are planned for the future.},
