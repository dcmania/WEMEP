	abstract = {The “Leipzig Wind Profile” is a unique example of a representative wind distribution in the frictional layer which resulted from Mildner's set of 28 pilot-balloon observations with two theodolites on October 20, 1931, near Leipzig for a stable weather situation. It is shown, that the vectors of geostrophic motion and ground drag follow from the wind profile when a scalar austausch is assumed. The re-computed vertical austausch-distribution indicates that the energy for maintaining the turbulence in a steady frictional wind profile is taken from the potential energy of the horizontal pressure field by means of the steady flow of air across the isobars.},

The E - ε model has been successfully applied to many flow problems in engineering applications for non-rotating boundary layers. In this paper, the E - ε method is extended to the atmospheric boundary layer for which a modification of the dissipation equation is found to be necessary in order to give results comparable with observational data.},

As such, the Leipzig data set has been extensively used in the development of computational models for planetary boundary-layer flows. To date, workers have assumed that the effect of stable stratification in the atmosphere over Leipzig was negligible. In the present work, a second-order turbulence closure that explicitly accounts for the effects of stable stratification is used to analyse the Leipzig data. The importance of stable stratification in this near-neutral data set is demonstrated.},
