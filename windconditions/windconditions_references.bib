The accuracy and the precision of the preconstruction energy estimates can dictate the profitability of the wind project. Historically, the wind industry tended to overpredict the annual energy production of wind farms. Experts have been dedicated to eliminating such prediction errors in the past decade, and recently the industry is recording near-zero average energy prediction bias. Herein, we present an overview of the energy yield assessment errors across the global wind energy industry. We identify a long-term trend of reduction in the overprediction bias, whereas the uncertainty associated with the prediction error is prominent. We also summarize the recent advancements of the wind resource assessment process that justify the bias reduction, including the improvements in modeling and measurement techniques. Additionally, because the energy losses and uncertainties substantially influence the prediction error, we document and examine the estimated and observed loss and uncertainty values from the literature, according to the proposed framework in the International Electrotechnical Commission 61400-15 wind resource assessment standard. From our findings, we highlight the opportunities for the industry to move forward, such as the validation and reduction of prediction uncertainty, and the prevention of energy losses caused by wake effect and environmental events. Overall, this study provides a summary on how the wind energy industry has been quantifying and reducing prediction errors, energy losses, and production uncertainties. Finally, for this work to be as reproducible as possible, we include all of the data used in the analysis in appendices to the manuscript.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The increasing size of wind turbines, with rotors already spanning more than 150 m diameter and hub heights above 100 m, requires proper modeling of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) from the surface to the free atmosphere. Furthermore, large wind farm arrays create their own boundary layer structure with unique physics. This poses significant challenges to traditional wind engineering models that rely on surface-layer theories and engineering wind farm models to simulate the flow in and around wind farms. However, adopting an ABL approach offers the opportunity to better integrate wind farm design tools and meteorological models. The challenge is how to build the bridge between atmospheric and wind engineering model communities and how to establish a comprehensive evaluation process that identifies relevant physical phenomena for wind energy applications with modeling and experimental requirements. A framework for model verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification is established to guide this process by a systematic evaluation of the modeling system at increasing levels of complexity. In terms of atmospheric physics, ‘building the bridge’ means developing models for the so-called ‘terra incognita,’ a term used to designate the turbulent scales that transition from mesoscale to microscale. This range of scales within atmospheric research deals with the transition from parameterized to resolved turbulence and the improvement of surface boundary-layer parameterizations. The coupling of meteorological and wind engineering flow models and the definition of a formal model evaluation methodology, is a strong area of research for the next generation of wind conditions assessment and wind farm and wind turbine design tools. Some fundamental challenges are identified in order to guide future research in this area.

It describes the sensitivity analysis and evaluation procedures that formed the basis for choosing the final setup of the mesoscale model simulations of the wind atlas. An optimal combination of model setup and parameterisations was found for simulating the climatology of the wind field at turbine-relevant heights with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Initial WRF model sensitivity experiments compared the wind climate generated by using two commonly used planetary boundary layer schemes and were carried out over several regions in Europe. They confirmed that the largest differences in annual mean wind speed at 100\&thinsp;m above ground level mostly coincide with areas of high surface roughness length and not with the location of the domains or maximum wind speed. Then an ensemble of more than 50 simulations with different setups for a single year was carried out for one domain covering Northern Europe, for which tall mast observations were available. Many different parameters were varied across the simulations, for example, model version, forcing data, various physical parameterisations and the size of the model domain. These simulations showed that although virtually every parameter change affects the results in some way, significant changes on the wind climate in the boundary layer are mostly due to using different physical parameterisations, especially the planetary boundary layer scheme, the representation of the land surface, and the prescribed surface roughness length. Also, the setup of the simulations, such as the integration length and the domain size can considerably influence the results. The degree of similarity between winds simulated by the WRF ensemble members and the observations was assessed using a suite of metrics, including the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), a statistic that measures the distance between two probability distributions. The EMD was used to diagnose the performance of each ensemble member using the full wind speed distribution, which is important for wind resource assessment. The most realistic ensemble members were identified to determine the most suitable configuration to be used in the final production run, which is fully described and evaluated in the second part of this study.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In Part 1, we described the sensitivity experiments and accompanying evaluation done to arrive at the final mesoscale model setup used to produce the mesoscale wind atlas. In this paper, Part 2, we document how we made the final wind atlas product, covering both the production of the mesoscale climatology generated with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the microscale climatology generated with the Wind Atlas Analysis and Applications Program (WAsP). The paper includes a detailed description of the technical and practical aspects that went into running the mesoscale simulations and the downscaling using WAsP. We show the main results from the final wind atlas and present a comprehensive evaluation of each component of the NEWA model chain using observations from a large set of tall masts located all over Europe. The added value of the WRF and WAsP downscaling of wind climatologies is evaluated relative to the performance of the driving ERA5 reanalysis and shows that the WRF downscaling reduces the mean wind speed bias and spread relative to that of ERA5 from \&minus;1.50\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;1.30 to 0.02\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.78\&thinsp;ms$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$. The WAsP downscaling has an added positive impact relative to that of the WRF model in simple terrain. In complex terrain, where the assumptions of the linearised flow model break down, both the mean bias and spread in wind speed are worse than the mesoscale results.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The New European Wind Atlas project will create a freely accessible wind atlas covering Europe and Turkey, develop the model chain to create the atlas and perform a series of experiments on flow in many different kinds of complex terrain to validate the models. This paper describes the experiments of which some are nearly completed while others are in the planning stage. All experiments focus on the flow properties that are relevant for wind turbines, so the main focus is the mean flow and the turbulence at heights between 40 and 300 m. Also extreme winds, wind shear and veer, and diurnal and seasonal variations of the wind are of interest. Common to all the experiments is the use of Doppler lidar systems to supplement and in some cases replace completely meteorological towers. Many of the lidars will be equipped with scan heads that will allow for arbitrary scan patterns by several synchronized systems. Two pilot experiments, one in Portugal and one in Germany, show the value of using multiple synchronized, scanning lidar, both in terms of the accuracy of the measurements and the atmospheric physical processes that can be studied. The experimental data will be used for validation of atmospheric flow models and will by the end of the project be freely available.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Wind energy in complex terrains’.},

	abstract = {We describe and analyze the results of the third global energy and water cycle experiment atmospheric boundary layer Study intercomparison and evaluation study for single-column models. Each of the nineteen participating models was operated with its own physics package, including land-surface, radiation and turbulent mixing schemes, for a full diurnal cycle selected from the Cabauw observatory archive. By carefully prescribing the temporal evolution of the forcings on the vertical column, the models could be evaluated against observations. We focus on the gross features of the stable boundary layer (SBL), such as the onset of evening momentum decoupling, the 2-m minimum temperature, the evolution of the inertial oscillation and the morning transition. New process diagrams are introduced to interpret the variety of model results and the relative importance of processes in the SBL; the diagrams include the results of a number of sensitivity runs performed with one of the models. The models are characterized in terms of thermal coupling to the soil, longwave radiation and turbulent mixing. It is shown that differences in longwave radiation schemes among the models have only a small effect on the simulations; however, there are significant variations in downward radiation due to different boundary-layer profiles of temperature and humidity. The differences in modelled thermal coupling to the land surface are large and explain most of the variations in 2-m air temperature and longwave incoming radiation among models. Models with strong turbulent mixing overestimate the boundary-layer height, underestimate the wind speed at 200 m, and give a relatively large downward sensible heat flux. The result is that 2-m air temperature is relatively insensitive to turbulent mixing intensity. Evening transition times spread 1.5 h around the observed time of transition, with later transitions for models with coarse resolution. Time of onset in the morning transition spreads 2 h around the observed transition time. With this case, the morning transition appeared to be difficult to study, no relation could be found between the studied processes, and the variation in the time of the morning transition among the models.},

A hierarchy of methodologies that rely on coupling mesoscale and microscale models is evaluated as a tradeoff between accuracy and computational cost in terms of relevant wind conditions for wind turbine siting such as annual energy production, turbulence intensity, etc. Besides integrated annual quantities, these metrics are analyzed in terms of atmospheric boundary-layer drivers at wind climate (mesoscale tendencies) and site characteristics (atmospheric stability).

A 40\$\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ \$\$∘wide wind-direction sector is selected as the most representative for large-scale forest conditions, and from that sector first-, second- and third-order statistics, as well as analyses regarding the characteristic length scale, the flux-profile relationship and surface roughness are presented for a wide range of stability conditions. The results are discussed with focus on the validity of different scaling regimes. Significant wind veer, decay of momentum fluxes and reduction in shear length scales with height are observed for all stability classes, indicating the influence of the limited depth of the boundary layer on the measured profiles. Roughness sublayer characteristics are however not detected in the presented analysis. Dimensionless gradients are shown to follow theoretical curves up to 100 m in stable conditions despite surface-layer approximations being invalid. This is attributed to a balance of momentum decay and reduced shear length scale growth with height. The wind profile shows a strong stability dependence of the aerodynamic roughness length, with a 50 \% decrease from neutral to stable conditions.},

The calculations were performed with Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) code OpenFOAM, with explicit modelling of the forest through drag coefficient and forest density. The findings indicate that a large modelling domain is needed in order to reproduce the measurements in different wind directions, since the effect of far upwind forest characteristics influence the wind and turbulence profiles. It is further shown that even though the low resolution of the LES simulations lead to slightly misrepresented single point turbulence characteristics, two point turbulence characteristics are well predicted due to spatial filtering of the small scales.},

	abstract = {The aim of the present work is to obtain a better understanding of how to model the thermally stratified wind field over a forest during full diurnal cycles. The setup of the study assumes a horizontally homogeneous forest, with the objective of finding a simple and efficient way to model the canopy flow using time-dependent input data, obtained from measurements and mesoscale simulations. With this, new insights can be gained for future microscale modelling of complex forested terrains using mesoscale input data. In terrain without forest a diurnal cycle is commonly simulated by imposing time-dependent ground temperature. However, the presence of forests partially isolates the temperature at ground level from the flow above the canopy, making this common approach ineffective. This work proposes imposing the time-dependent net radiation at the forest canopy top to drive the thermal stratification changes along the diurnal cycle. To this end, several full days of simulation are driven by prescribing the net radiative heat flux balance measured on top of the canopy, together with a geostrophic pressure gradient. The advantage of the method is its simplicity and that the input data can be easily obtained from mesoscale modelling. When compared to the observations at the Swedish site Ryningsnas, the new method dramatically improves estimations of wind speed, wind direction and turbulent kinetic energy compared to simulations that only assume neutral stratification. Out of the variables studied, temperature and turbulent heat flux profiles were the ones that qualitatively followed the measurements the best, while wind speed and turbulent kinetic energy showed a larger disagreement.},

The task was to model the wind field in stationary conditions with neutral stratification by using the wind velocity measured at 100\&thinsp;m at a metmast as the only reference.

The participants were free to apply their best practices for the simulation to decide the size of the domain, the value of the geostrophic wind, and every other modelling parameter. The comparison of the results with the measurements is shown for the vertical profiles of wind speed, shear, wind direction, and turbulent kinetic energy. The ALS-based data resulted in reasonable agreement of the wind profile and turbulence magnitude. The best performance was found to be that of large-eddy simulations using a very large domain. For the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes type of models, the constants in the turbulence closure were shown to have a great influence on the yielded turbulence level, but were of much less importance for the wind speed profile. Of the variety of closure constants used by the participating modellers, the closure constants from {\textless}span class="cit" id="xref\_text.1"{\textgreater}{\textless}a href="\#bib1.bibx45"{\textgreater}Sogachev and Panferov{\textless}/a{\textgreater} ({\textless}a href="\#bib1.bibx45"{\textgreater}2006{\textless}/a{\textgreater}){\textless}/span{\textgreater} proved to agree best with the measurements.

	abstract = {This report summarizes the first round of benchmarks conducted under the NEWA validation strategy. An update of the validation program is provided with a schedule of forthcoming benchmarking activities based on the availability of experimental data. This report is the first of a series of three annual reports on NEWA benchmarks. The first phase of the project has resulted in three main activities with a common objective of defining a baseline model-chain both at mesoscale and microscale levels. The Mesoscale Sensitivity Test consisted on executing a sensitivity analysis of the WRF model coordinated by the NEWA mesoscale group around four European regions. This activity has been reported separately in deliverable 3.1 and concluded with the definition of a reference WRF set-up that will be used to produce the European Wind Atlas. Validation of this reference WRF configuration will be conducted in connection to the beta run of the wind atlas using available tall mast data from research and industry sites. The Ryningsnäs Blind Test benchmark gathered a group of microscale modelers to simulate the mean profile of an atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) above a heterogeneous forest canopy on flat terrain and neutral atmospheric conditions. This benchmark tested canopy models that can use high-resolution canopy maps generated from aerial lidar scans. The results are currently compiled in to an article. The main findings are that the involved modeling groups, using models ranging from advanced industrial codes to state-of-the-art research codes, shows good agreement regarding mean wind profiles. The magnitude of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) generally match the observed one, but does not show the same directional dependence as the observed. The inability to model non-neutral conditions was striking. The learning outcome from the benchmark consortium is large and many key questions for future studies in the Hornamossen, i.e., from the extensive Swedish measurement campaign launched within NEWA, benchmark are defined. The GABLS3 diurnal-cycle benchmark for wind energy applications revisited the original case developed by the boundary-layer meteorology community and adapted it to match the specific objectives of NEWA. Here, microscale modelers were asked to demonstrate that they can reproduce a real diurnal cycle with varying atmospheric stability and using input forcing produced offline from a mesoscale model (proxy for a wind atlas database). Mesoscale tendencies generated from WRF were provided as input to drive ABL RANS and LES models. All the models showed good consistency at assimilating tendencies even though some scatter remains depending on the particular settings of each code. At this stage, we arrive to the first important milestone of the NEWA model-chain development, namely, the definition of a reference model-chain that includes: A reference WRF configuration derived after sensitivity analysis in various European regions. A reference canopy model implementation in microscale ABL models that can use high-resolution aerial lidar scans. A methodology for offline coupling of microscale models with mesoscale tendencies and transient turbulence modeling of varying atmospheric stability conditions. Next round of benchmarks will use experimental data recently produced by NEWA experiments to test these reference models in complex terrain, coastal and offshore environments. Meso-micro methodologies will be compared in terms of annual wind resource statistics using a hierarchy of models of varying fidelity levels. This will allow differentiating methods suitable for planning (wind atlas) or design phases of wind energy projects.},

The campaign was conducted from November 2015 to February 2016 on the west coast of Denmark and comprises measurements from eight lidars, an ocean buoy and three types of satellites. The wind speed was estimated based on measurements from a scanning lidar performing PPIs, two scanning lidars performing dual synchronized scans, and five vertical profiling lidars, of which one was operating offshore on a floating platform. The availability of measurements is highest for the profiling lidars, followed by the lidar performing PPIs, those performing the dual setup, and the lidar buoy. Analysis of the lidar measurements reveals good agreement between the estimated 10-min wind speeds, although the instruments used different scanning strategies and measured different volumes in the atmosphere. The campaign is characterized by strong westerlies with occasional storms.},

Due to the existence of the motion effects, the obtained data are essentially different from typical on-site data used for wind resource assessments in the wind industry. First comparisons show that they can be well related to mapped wind trajectories from the output of a numerical weather prediction model showing a reasonable correlation.

	abstract = {This report summarizes the third round of benchmarks conducted under the NEWA validation strategy [1]. The first round of microscale benchmarks [2] was directed to developing microscale models that can be driven with mesoscale input forcing, include thermal stratification of the atmospheric boundary layer and high resolution digital models of heterogeneous forest canopy characteristics based on aerial lidar-scan data. These fundamental implementations were developed around the GABLS3 diurnal-cycle and Ryningsnäs forest canopy benchmarks, both in flat terrain conditions. By model intercomparison, NEWA modelers found reasonably good consistency in the simulation of these cases, establishing common understanding of the modeling capabilities of the group before attempting more complex simulation challenges in connection to the NEWA experiments. The second round of benchmarks [3] focused on flow modeling over forested terrain based on the Rödeser Berg and Hornamossen experiments to add terrain complexity to the baseline settings used in GABLS3 and Ryningsnäs. A follow-up benchmark from GABLS3, based at the Cabauw tower, served to launch the “NEWA Meso-Micro Challenge for Wind Resource Assessment” to address the evaluation of a hierarchy of methodologies that incorporate mesoscale-to-microscale downscaling and understand the added-value compared to traditional approaches for site assessment that rely only on microscale modeling. The third round continues with the second phase of the challenge in complex terrain, starting with Rödeser Berg. Following the NEWA validation strategy the benchmarks will be directed to flow cases targeting the validation of specific phenomena, as well as case studies that integrate these models in wind resource assessment methodologies to assess the impact on relevant quantities of interest for the wind industry such as annual energy prediction, site assessment characteristics, mean profiles, etc. Additionally, the Ferry Lidar benchmark was launched to test mesoscale models predicting the wind profile along a ship track in the Southern Baltic Sea.  With the NEWA project concluded, the meso-micro challenge will continue in the frame of the IEA-Wind Task 31 “Wakebench” as new benchmarks are generated from the database of experiments [4].},

The experiment was performed at the Østerild test station for large wind turbines in Northern Denmark, from April to August 2016. The two 250 m meteorological towers available at the test site were equipped with balconies, first at 50 m above local ground level, later raised to 200 m. Scanning lidars were placed on each of the balconies, performing horizontal scans over 90° arcs with an east or west orientation depending on the incoming wind direction. The purpose of this study is to describe i) the new filtering method applied to the data, ii) the wind field reconstruction and the iii) utilisation of the derived wind fields to examine the imprint of surface heterogeneity on the mean wind flow. Cloud point data from aerial lidar scans were used to accurately derive the terrain and tree height. The mean wind flow patterns appeared to be heavily influenced by the terrain characteristics at the height of 50 m above ground level.},

	abstract = {Large-eddy simulations of the neutrally stratified flow over the Askervein Hill were performed, to improve the knowledge of the flow obtained from field measurements and numerical simulations with Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) methods. A Lagrangian dynamic subgrid model was used but, to avoid the underdissipative character near the ground, it was merged with a damped Smagorinsky model. Simulations of a flat boundary-layer flow with this subgrid model showed that the turbulent vertical motions and shear stress were better resolved using grids with a stream to spanwise aspect ratio Δx / Δy = 2 than with an aspect ratio Δx / Δy = 1. Regarding the flow over the Askervein Hill, it was found that large-eddy simulations provide an acceptable solution for the mean-velocity field and better predictions of the turbulent kinetic energy in the upstream side of the hill than the \$\$k - {\textbackslash}varepsilon\$\$model. However, as with the \$\$k - {\textbackslash}varepsilon\$\$model, grid convergence was not achieved in the lee side and the size of the zone with reversed flow increased with the grid refinement. Nevertheless, the existence of the intermittent separation predicted with unsteady RANS in part one of this work seems unquestionable, due to the deceleration of the flow. In our opinion, a better modelling of the decelerating boundary layer in the lee side is required to improve the results obtained using equilibrium assumptions and achieve grid convergence.},

	abstract = {The flow solver “3DWind” is used to explore new aspects of the Askervein hill flow case. Previous work has investigated sensitivities to the grid, the inflow boundary profile, the roughness and the turbulence model. Several different linear and non-linear numerical models have also been validated by means of the Askervein hill case. This analysis focuses on the flow sensitivity to the grid spacing, the incident wind direction and the vertical resolution of topographic data. The horizontal resolution is found to be fine enough to cause only minor differences compared to a grid where every second node is removed. The vertical resolution dependence is mainly attributed to the wall functions. Simulations are performed for wind directions 200°, 205°, 210° and 215° at the reference station. The smallest directional biases compared to experimental values along a line through the hilltop are found for the directions 200° and 205°. There are larger wind direction changes along this line through the hilltop in the 200° case than in the 215° case. Still the simulation results give less veering than found in the experimental results, and this is maybe caused by a slightly stable atmosphere. The sensitivity to the vertical resolution of the topographical data is found to be particularly high close to the ground at the top of the hill; this is where the speed-up is most important. Differences decrease with the height from the ground. At higher levels the speed-ups are smaller and caused by terrain formations with larger scales.},

The spectral approach in the two horizontal coordinates and the finite-difference method in the vertical combines the simplicity and computational efficiency of linear methods with flexibility for closure schemes of finite-difference methods. This model makes it possible to make high-resolution computations for an arbitrary distribution of surface roughness and topography. Mixing-length closure as well as E − ε closure are applied to two-dimensional flow above sinusoidal variations in surface roughness, the step-in-roughness problem, and to two-dimensional flow over simple sinusoidal topography. The main difference between the two closure schemes is found in the shear-stress results. E − ε has a more realistic description of the memory effects in length and velocity scales when the surface conditions change. Comparison between three-dimensional model calculations and field data from Askervein hill shows that in the outer layer, the advection effects in the shear stress itself are also important. In this layer, an extra equation for the shear stress is needed.},

	abstract = {The use of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to predict wall-bounded flows has presently been limited to low Reynolds number flows. Since the number of computational grid points required to resolve the near-wall turbulent structures increase rapidly with Reynolds number, LES has been unattainable for flows at high Reynolds numbers. To reduce the computational cost of traditional LES, a hybrid method is proposed in which the near-wall eddies are modelled in a Reynolds-averaged sense. Close to walls, the flow is treated with the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations (unsteady RANS), and this layer acts as wall model for the outer flow handled by LES. The well-known high Reynolds number two-equation k − ϵ turbulence model is used in the RANS layer and the model automatically switches to a two-equation k − ϵ subgrid scale stress model in the LES region. The approach can be used for flow over rough walls. Previous attempts of combining RANS and LES has resulted in unphysical transition regions between the two layers, but the present work improves this region by using a stochastic backscatter model. To demonstrate the ability of the proposed hybrid method, simulations are presented for wind flow over the Askervein hill. Comparisons show that both RANS and the new hybrid model are able to capture the simple flow windward of the hill. In the complex wake region, however, the RANS and the hybrid model give different results. The RANS model predicts the mean velocity well but underestimates the turbulent kinetic energy, whereas the new method captures the high turbulence levels well but underestimates the mean velocity. The presented results are for a relative mild configuration of complex terrain, but the proposed method can also be used for highly complex terrain where the benefits of the new method is expected to be larger.

The first part focuses on LES simulation results from a series of sensitivity studies carried out at the Rödeser Berg site to investigate the model’s sensitivity towards forest representations and grid resolution. The results indicate that a representation of the forest in terms of roughness only is not capable in correctly resolving the wind conditions on top of a forested hill, while a forest parametrization that accounts for the drag in the lowest grid cells improves the results significantly. The second part of the report summarizes the (anonymous) results of the first round of benchmarks carried out at the Rödeser Berg site where several RANS and LES modelers handed in simulated wind profiles at several locations during a southwesterly flow. These model results are compared to wind profile measurements at different positions across the Rödeser Berg. The results indicate that neutrally stratified situations can be modeled well by most models but, especially in forested areas, the model results strongly depend on the forest model chosen. In stably stratified situations the model results strongly differ, especially in areas downstream of topography features, i.e. the wakes of hills. Further research is needed in these areas. The Rödeser Berg experimental data offer a great opportunity for future further validation of models and verification of new models and parameterizations against measurement data.},

	abstract = {This report summarizes the second round of benchmarks conducted under the NEWA validation strategy. This report is the second of a series of three annual reports on NEWA benchmarks. The first round of microscale benchmarks was directed to developing microscale models that can be driven with mesoscale input forcing, include thermal stratification of the atmospheric boundary layer and high resolution digital models of heterogeneous forest canopy characteristics based on aerial lidar-scan data. These fundamental implementations were developed around the GABLS3 diurnal-cycle and Ryningsnäs forest canopy benchmarks, both in flat terrain conditions. By model intercomparison, NEWA modelers found reasonably good consistency in the simulation of these cases, establishing common understanding of the modeling capabilities of the group before attempting more complex simulation challenges in connection to the NEWA experiments. The first release of the NEWA model chain is produced based on this first round of benchmarks. CFDWind3 is published open-access to engage with early adopters that can help testing and eventually developing new functionalities alongside the NEWA validation plans.  The second round of benchmarks has been focused on the following objectives: Validation of flow models from flat to hilly forested terrain: Experimental data from the Rödeser Berg and Hornamossen experiments add terrain complexity to the baseline settings used in GABLS3 and Ryningsnäs. Following the Ryningsnäs approach, a blind test addressing steady-state models was organized around the Rödeser Berg forested hill benchmark. On the other hand, Hornamossen followed the GABLS3 approach to challenge transient models in the simulation of diurnal cycles on an undulated forested landscape. Assessment of annual wind conditions relevant for wind resource assessment and site suitability. The “NEWA Meso-Micro Challenge for Wind Resource Assessment” addresses the evaluation of a hierarchy of methodologies that incorporate mesoscale-to-microscale downscaling to understand the added-value compared to traditional approaches for site assessment that rely only on microscale modeling. This challenge is divided in two phases: the first one in flat terrain and the second one in complex terrain conditions. This report summarizes results for the first phase based on Cabauw and Fino1 sites in onshore and offshore conditions. Development of an open-science benchmarking approach: the benchmarking process established in GABLS3 is rolled out in the next benchmarks to promote a more traceable model evaluation based on sharing of simulation data and evaluation scripts.   This report presents benchmark guides for Rödeser Berg, Hornamossen and the NEWA Meso-Micro Challenge and initial results published for the first phase of the Challenge.  The third round of benchmarks will exploit experimental data in complex terrain in terms of flow cases targeting the validation of specific modeling features, as well as case studies that integrate these models in wind resource assessment methodologies to assess the impact of those features in terms of relevant quantities of interest for the wind industry (annual energy prediction, site assessment characteristics, mean profiles, etc).},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of data from a measurement campaign performed at the Bolund peninsula in Denmark in the winter of 2007–2008. Bolund is a small isolated hill exhibiting a significantly steep escarpment in the main wind direction. The physical shape of Bolund represents, in a scaled-down form, a typical wind turbine site in complex terrain. Because of its small size the effect of atmospheric stratification can be neglected, which makes the Bolund experiment ideal for the validation of neutral flow models and hence model scenarios most relevant to wind energy. We have carefully investigated the upstream conditions. With a 7-km fetch over water, the incoming flow is characterized as flow over flat terrain with a local roughness height based on the surface momentum flux. The nearly perfect upstream conditions are important in forming a meaningful quantitative description of the flow over the Bolund hill. Depending on the wind direction, we find a maximum speed-up of 30\% at the hill top accompanied by a maximum 300\% enhancement of turbulence intensity. A closer inspection reveals transient behaviour with recirculation zones. From the wind energy context, this implies that the best site for erecting a turbine based on resource constraints unfortunately also imposes a penalty of high dynamic loads. On the lee side of Bolund, recirculation occurs with the turbulence intensity remaining significantly enhanced even at one hill length downstream. Its transient behaviour and many recirculation zones place Bolund in a category in which the linear flow theory is not applicable.},

However, of the submitted LES results, all had difficulties in applying the specified boundary conditions and all had large speed-up errors. In contrast, the physical models both managed to apply undisturbed ‘free wind’ boundary conditions and achieve good speed-up results. The most successful models were RANS with two-equation closures.

	abstract = {In the wind-energy sector, wind-power forecasting, turbine siting, and turbine-design selection are all highly dependent on a precise evaluation of atmospheric wind conditions. On-site measurements provide reliable data; however, in complex terrain and at the scale of a wind farm, local measurements may be insufficient for a detailed site description. On highly variable terrain, numerical models are commonly used but still constitute a challenge regarding simulation and interpretation. We propose a joint state-of-the-art study of two approaches to modelling atmospheric flow over the Bolund hill: a wind-tunnel test and a large-eddy simulation (LES). The approach has the particularity of describing both methods in parallel in order to highlight their similarities and differences. The work provides a first detailed comparison between field measurements, wind-tunnel experiments and numerical simulations. The systematic and quantitative approach used for the comparison contributes to a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each model and, therefore, to their enhancement. Despite fundamental modelling differences, both techniques result in only a 5 \% difference in the mean wind speed and 15 \% in the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). The joint comparison makes it possible to identify the most difficult features to model: the near-ground flow and the wake of the hill. When compared to field data, both models reach 11 \% error for the mean wind speed, which is close to the best performance reported in the literature. For the TKE, a great improvement is found using the LES model compared to previous studies (20 \% error). Wind-tunnel results are in the low range of error when compared to experiments reported previously (40 \% error). This comparison highlights the potential of such approaches and gives directions for the improvement of complex flow modelling.},

	abstract = {Simulation of local atmospheric flows around complex topography is important for several applications in wind energy (short-term wind forecasting and turbine siting and control), local weather prediction in mountainous regions and avalanche risk assessment. However, atmospheric simulation around steep mountain topography remains challenging, and a number of different approaches are used to represent such topography in numerical models. The immersed boundary method (IBM) is particularly well-suited for efficient and numerically stable simulation of flow around steep terrain. It uses a homogenous grid and permits a fast meshing of the topography. Here, we use the IBM in conjunction with a large-eddy simulation (LES) and test it against two unique datasets. In the first comparison, the LES is used to reproduce experimental results from a wind-tunnel study of a smooth three-dimensional hill. In the second comparison, we simulate the wind field around the Bolund Hill, Denmark, and make direct comparisons with field measurements. Both cases show good agreement between the simulation results and the experimental data, with the largest disagreement observed near the surface. The source of error is investigated by performing additional simulations with a variety of spatial resolutions and surface roughness properties.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACTThe Bolund experiment has been reproduced in a neutral boundary layer wind tunnel (WT) at scale 1:115 for two Reynolds numbers. All the results have been obtained for an incoming flow from the 270 o wind direction (transect B in the Bolund experiment jargon). Vertical scans of the velocity field are obtained using non-time resolved two components particle image velocimetry. Time-resolved velocity time series with a three component hot-wire probe have been also measured for transects at 2 and 5 m height and in the vertical transects at met masts M6, M3 and M8 locations. Special attention has been devoted to the detailed characterization of the inflow in order to reduce uncertainties in future comparisons with other physical and numerical simulations. Emphasis is placed on the analysis of spectral functions of the undisturbed flow and those of the flow above the island. The result's reproducibility and trustworthiness have been addressed through redundancy measurements using particle image velocimetry, two and three components hot-wire anemometry. The bias in the prediction of the mean speed is similar to the one reported during the Bolund experiment by the physical modellers. However, certain reduction of the bias in the estimation of the turbulent kinetic energy is achieved. The WT results of spectra and cosprectra have revealed a behaviour similar to the full-scale measurements in some relevant locations, showing that WT modelling can contribute to provide valid information about these important structural loading factors.

ALEX17 aims to present a utility-scale measurements campaign to characterize the wind flow in complex terrain, through a combination of measurement technologies. Having finalized the measurements campaign and processed all the information, the wind flow in the area of study can be characterized for different weather conditions. In addition, the experimental data will be able to validate the reliability of numeric simulation models of wind flow in complex terrain, in order to reduce uncertainties when evaluating the wind resource.},

We select two flow cases where topographic-flow interactions were measured by five synchronized scanning Doppler wind lidars along a 10-km transect line, including a cross-section of the valley flow. We observed a hydraulic jump in the lee-side of the mountain. The Froude number transition from supercritical ({\textgreater}\&thinsp;1) at the mountain to subcritical ({\textless}\&thinsp;1) at the valley is in agreement with previous experiments at a smaller scale. For a one-year period, the measurements show such a transition about 10\&thinsp;\% of the time, indicating a possible high occurrence of hydraulic jumps. The second flow case presents valley winds that are decoupled from the northerly flow aloft and show a stratified layered pattern, which is well captured by the lidar scans. These measurements can aid the evaluation of multi-scale numerical models as well as improving our knowledge with regards to mountain meteorology.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
