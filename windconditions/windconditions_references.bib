The accuracy and the precision of the preconstruction energy estimates can dictate the profitability of the wind project. Historically, the wind industry tended to overpredict the annual energy production of wind farms. Experts have been dedicated to eliminating such prediction errors in the past decade, and recently the industry is recording near-zero average energy prediction bias. Herein, we present an overview of the energy yield assessment errors across the global wind energy industry. We identify a long-term trend of reduction in the overprediction bias, whereas the uncertainty associated with the prediction error is prominent. We also summarize the recent advancements of the wind resource assessment process that justify the bias reduction, including the improvements in modeling and measurement techniques. Additionally, because the energy losses and uncertainties substantially influence the prediction error, we document and examine the estimated and observed loss and uncertainty values from the literature, according to the proposed framework in the International Electrotechnical Commission 61400-15 wind resource assessment standard. From our findings, we highlight the opportunities for the industry to move forward, such as the validation and reduction of prediction uncertainty, and the prevention of energy losses caused by wake effect and environmental events. Overall, this study provides a summary on how the wind energy industry has been quantifying and reducing prediction errors, energy losses, and production uncertainties. Finally, for this work to be as reproducible as possible, we include all of the data used in the analysis in appendices to the manuscript.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The increasing size of wind turbines, with rotors already spanning more than 150 m diameter and hub heights above 100 m, requires proper modeling of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) from the surface to the free atmosphere. Furthermore, large wind farm arrays create their own boundary layer structure with unique physics. This poses significant challenges to traditional wind engineering models that rely on surface-layer theories and engineering wind farm models to simulate the flow in and around wind farms. However, adopting an ABL approach offers the opportunity to better integrate wind farm design tools and meteorological models. The challenge is how to build the bridge between atmospheric and wind engineering model communities and how to establish a comprehensive evaluation process that identifies relevant physical phenomena for wind energy applications with modeling and experimental requirements. A framework for model verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification is established to guide this process by a systematic evaluation of the modeling system at increasing levels of complexity. In terms of atmospheric physics, ‘building the bridge’ means developing models for the so-called ‘terra incognita,’ a term used to designate the turbulent scales that transition from mesoscale to microscale. This range of scales within atmospheric research deals with the transition from parameterized to resolved turbulence and the improvement of surface boundary-layer parameterizations. The coupling of meteorological and wind engineering flow models and the definition of a formal model evaluation methodology, is a strong area of research for the next generation of wind conditions assessment and wind farm and wind turbine design tools. Some fundamental challenges are identified in order to guide future research in this area.

It describes the sensitivity analysis and evaluation procedures that formed the basis for choosing the final setup of the mesoscale model simulations of the wind atlas. An optimal combination of model setup and parameterisations was found for simulating the climatology of the wind field at turbine-relevant heights with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Initial WRF model sensitivity experiments compared the wind climate generated by using two commonly used planetary boundary layer schemes and were carried out over several regions in Europe. They confirmed that the largest differences in annual mean wind speed at 100\&thinsp;m above ground level mostly coincide with areas of high surface roughness length and not with the location of the domains or maximum wind speed. Then an ensemble of more than 50 simulations with different setups for a single year was carried out for one domain covering Northern Europe, for which tall mast observations were available. Many different parameters were varied across the simulations, for example, model version, forcing data, various physical parameterisations and the size of the model domain. These simulations showed that although virtually every parameter change affects the results in some way, significant changes on the wind climate in the boundary layer are mostly due to using different physical parameterisations, especially the planetary boundary layer scheme, the representation of the land surface, and the prescribed surface roughness length. Also, the setup of the simulations, such as the integration length and the domain size can considerably influence the results. The degree of similarity between winds simulated by the WRF ensemble members and the observations was assessed using a suite of metrics, including the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), a statistic that measures the distance between two probability distributions. The EMD was used to diagnose the performance of each ensemble member using the full wind speed distribution, which is important for wind resource assessment. The most realistic ensemble members were identified to determine the most suitable configuration to be used in the final production run, which is fully described and evaluated in the second part of this study.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In Part 1, we described the sensitivity experiments and accompanying evaluation done to arrive at the final mesoscale model setup used to produce the mesoscale wind atlas. In this paper, Part 2, we document how we made the final wind atlas product, covering both the production of the mesoscale climatology generated with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the microscale climatology generated with the Wind Atlas Analysis and Applications Program (WAsP). The paper includes a detailed description of the technical and practical aspects that went into running the mesoscale simulations and the downscaling using WAsP. We show the main results from the final wind atlas and present a comprehensive evaluation of each component of the NEWA model chain using observations from a large set of tall masts located all over Europe. The added value of the WRF and WAsP downscaling of wind climatologies is evaluated relative to the performance of the driving ERA5 reanalysis and shows that the WRF downscaling reduces the mean wind speed bias and spread relative to that of ERA5 from \&minus;1.50\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;1.30 to 0.02\&thinsp;\&plusmn;\&thinsp;0.78\&thinsp;ms$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$. The WAsP downscaling has an added positive impact relative to that of the WRF model in simple terrain. In complex terrain, where the assumptions of the linearised flow model break down, both the mean bias and spread in wind speed are worse than the mesoscale results.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The New European Wind Atlas project will create a freely accessible wind atlas covering Europe and Turkey, develop the model chain to create the atlas and perform a series of experiments on flow in many different kinds of complex terrain to validate the models. This paper describes the experiments of which some are nearly completed while others are in the planning stage. All experiments focus on the flow properties that are relevant for wind turbines, so the main focus is the mean flow and the turbulence at heights between 40 and 300 m. Also extreme winds, wind shear and veer, and diurnal and seasonal variations of the wind are of interest. Common to all the experiments is the use of Doppler lidar systems to supplement and in some cases replace completely meteorological towers. Many of the lidars will be equipped with scan heads that will allow for arbitrary scan patterns by several synchronized systems. Two pilot experiments, one in Portugal and one in Germany, show the value of using multiple synchronized, scanning lidar, both in terms of the accuracy of the measurements and the atmospheric physical processes that can be studied. The experimental data will be used for validation of atmospheric flow models and will by the end of the project be freely available.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Wind energy in complex terrains’.},

It is also characterized by a pronounced low-level jet related to an inertial oscillation that developed around sunset when the atmosphere had decoupled from the surface.

Dimensionless gradients are shown to follow theoretical curves up to 100 m in stable conditions despite surface-layer approximations being invalid.

The wind speed was estimated based on measurements from a scanning lidar performing PPIs, two scanning lidars performing dual synchronized scans, and five vertical profiling lidars, of which one was operating offshore on a floating platform. The availability of measurements is highest for the profiling lidars, followed by the lidar performing PPIs, those performing the dual setup, and the lidar buoy.

	abstract = {One of the main objectives of the New European Wind Atlas (NEWA) project is to carry out large scale field experiments at a high spatial and temporal resolution, and provide a significant upgrade to the experimental databases currently available. The Østerild balconies experiment aimed at collecting measurements over a relatively flat and semi-forested terrain to quantify the effect of various terrain features on the mean wind field. The experiment was performed at the Østerild test station for large wind turbines in Northern Denmark, from April to August 2016. The two 250 m meteorological towers available at the test site were equipped with balconies, first at 50 m above local ground level, later raised to 200 m. Scanning lidars were placed on each of the balconies, performing horizontal scans over 90° arcs with an east or west orientation depending on the incoming wind direction. The purpose of this study is to describe i) the new filtering method applied to the data, ii) the wind field reconstruction and the iii) utilisation of the derived wind fields to examine the imprint of surface heterogeneity on the mean wind flow. Cloud point data from aerial lidar scans were used to accurately derive the terrain and tree height. The mean wind flow patterns appeared to be heavily influenced by the terrain characteristics at the height of 50 m above ground level.},

The first part focuses on LES simulation results from a series of sensitivity studies carried out at the Rödeser Berg site to investigate the model’s sensitivity towards forest representations and grid resolution. The results indicate that a representation of the forest in terms of roughness only is not capable in correctly resolving the wind conditions on top of a forested hill, while a forest parametrization that accounts for the drag in the lowest grid cells improves the results significantly. The second part of the report summarizes the (anonymous) results of the first round of benchmarks carried out at the Rödeser Berg site where several RANS and LES modelers handed in simulated wind profiles at several locations during a southwesterly flow. These model results are compared to wind profile measurements at different positions across the Rödeser Berg. The results indicate that neutrally stratified situations can be modeled well by most models but, especially in forested areas, the model results strongly depend on the forest model chosen. In stably stratified situations the model results strongly differ, especially in areas downstream of topography features, i.e. the wakes of hills. Further research is needed in these areas. The Rödeser Berg experimental data offer a great opportunity for future further validation of models and verification of new models and parameterizations against measurement data.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of data from a measurement campaign performed at the Bolund peninsula in Denmark in the winter of 2007–2008. Bolund is a small isolated hill exhibiting a significantly steep escarpment in the main wind direction. The physical shape of Bolund represents, in a scaled-down form, a typical wind turbine site in complex terrain. Because of its small size the effect of atmospheric stratification can be neglected, which makes the Bolund experiment ideal for the validation of neutral flow models and hence model scenarios most relevant to wind energy. We have carefully investigated the upstream conditions. With a 7-km fetch over water, the incoming flow is characterized as flow over flat terrain with a local roughness height based on the surface momentum flux. The nearly perfect upstream conditions are important in forming a meaningful quantitative description of the flow over the Bolund hill. Depending on the wind direction, we find a maximum speed-up of 30\% at the hill top accompanied by a maximum 300\% enhancement of turbulence intensity. A closer inspection reveals transient behaviour with recirculation zones. From the wind energy context, this implies that the best site for erecting a turbine based on resource constraints unfortunately also imposes a penalty of high dynamic loads. On the lee side of Bolund, recirculation occurs with the turbulence intensity remaining significantly enhanced even at one hill length downstream. Its transient behaviour and many recirculation zones place Bolund in a category in which the linear flow theory is not applicable.},

Fifty-seven models ranging from numerical to physical were used, including large-eddy simulation (LES) models, Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) models, and linearized models, in addition to wind-tunnel and water-channel experiments. Many assumptions of linearized models were violated when simulating the flow around Bolund. As expected, these models showed large errors. Expectations were higher for LES models. However, of the submitted LES results, all had difficulties in applying the specified boundary conditions and all had large speed-up errors. In contrast, the physical models both managed to apply undisturbed ‘free wind’ boundary conditions and achieve good speed-up results. The most successful models were RANS with two-equation closures. These models gave the lowest errors with respect to speed-up and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) prediction.},

We select two flow cases where topographic-flow interactions were measured by five synchronized scanning Doppler wind lidars along a 10-km transect line, including a cross-section of the valley flow. We observed a hydraulic jump in the lee-side of the mountain. The Froude number transition from supercritical ({\textgreater}\&thinsp;1) at the mountain to subcritical ({\textless}\&thinsp;1) at the valley is in agreement with previous experiments at a smaller scale. For a one-year period, the measurements show such a transition about 10\&thinsp;\% of the time, indicating a possible high occurrence of hydraulic jumps. The second flow case presents valley winds that are decoupled from the northerly flow aloft and show a stratified layered pattern, which is well captured by the lidar scans. These measurements can aid the evaluation of multi-scale numerical models as well as improving our knowledge with regards to mountain meteorology.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The single-column parameterizations include research and operational schemes from major forecast and climate research centres. Results from first-order schemes, a large number of turbulence kinetic energy closures, and other models were used. There is a large spread in the results; in general, the operational schemes mix over a deeper layer than the research schemes, and the turbulence kinetic energy and other higher-order closures give results closer to the statistics obtained from the large-eddy simulations.

A hierarchy of test cases has been proposed for flow-over-terrain model evaluation, from Monin- Obukhov similarity theory for verification of surface-layer properties, to the Leipzig profile for the near-neutral atmospheric boundary layer, to flow over isolated hills (Askervein and Bolund) to flow over mountaneous complex terrain (Alaiz). A summary of results from the first benchmarks are used to illustrate the model evaluation protocol applied to flow-over-terrain modeling in neutral conditions.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} The GEWEX Atmospheric Boundary Layer Studies (GABLS) 1, 2 and 3 are used to develop a methodology for the design and testing of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) models for wind energy applications. The first two GABLS cases are based on idealized boundary conditions and are suitable for verification purposes by comparing with results from higher-fidelity models based on large-eddy simulation. Results from three single-column RANS models, of 1st, 1.5th and 2nd turbulence closure order, show high consistency in predicting the mean flow. The third GABLS case is suitable for the study of these ABL models under realistic forcing such that validation versus observations from the Cabauw meteorological tower are possible. The case consists on a diurnal cycle that leads to a nocturnal low-level jet and addresses fundamental questions related to the definition of the large-scale forcing, the interaction of the ABL with the surface and the evaluation of model results with observations. The simulations are evaluated in terms of surface-layer fluxes and wind energy quantities of interest: rotor equivalent wind speed, hub-height wind direction, wind speed shear and wind direction veer. The characterization of mesoscale forcing is based on spatially and temporally averaged momentum budget terms from Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations. These mesoscale tendencies are used to drive single-column models, which were verified previously in the first two GABLS cases, to first demonstrate that they can produce similar wind profile characteristics to the WRF simulations even though the physics are more simplified. The added value of incorporating different forcing mechanisms into microscale models is quantified by systematically removing forcing terms in the momentum and heat equations. This mesoscale-to-microscale modeling approach is affected, to a large extent, by the input uncertainties of the mesoscale tendencies. Deviations from the profile observations are reduced by introducing observational nudging based on measurements that are typically available from wind energy campaigns. This allows the discussion of the added value of using remote sensing instruments versus tower measurements in the assessment of wind profiles for tall wind turbines reaching heights of 200 m.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
